ProxyBox v1.0
==============

This is the modified version of the official Python Dropbox SDK, modified from version 1.2. The rest.py file has been modified to use urllib2 now, so the programmer doesn't have to worry about getting around proxies when developing apps from Dropbox. 

To install the modified SDK just download all the files as normal and installl in the normal way, python setup.py install. 

I did this for my 3rd Year Project (dissertation), which needed to get around the campus network (which used a proxy). It took me many hours of suffering to get this working, so maybe it'll save someone else the trouble. 

Use it however you want, we'll say it's under one of those licenses where you can do whatever with it. Just don't be evil.
